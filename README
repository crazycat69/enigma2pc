------------------------------
Tested on
------------------------------
Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit, Nvidia cards with VDPAU support

------------------------------
BUILDING openpliPC
------------------------------

1a) download openpliPC git repo as local user (not root):
git clone https://github.com/Raider05/enigma2pc.git
cd enigma2pc/

 - OR -

1b) Keep in sync previously cloned git repo:
cd enigma2pc/
git pull https://github.com/Raider05/enigma2pc.git


2) Building needed openpliPC enigma2 libraries:
It download, build and install all needed libraries
Some tasks require root access (sudo). You will be asked for your password.
This task must be run ONCE at the first time. These libs are compiled from
its original sources and aren't patched anyway.

./build_libs.sh
If you are interested to have a logfile , simply do:
./build_libs.sh 2>&1 | tee build_libs.log


3) Build Xine-lib and openpliPC Enigma2:
It compile and install xine-lib and the openpliPC Enigma2.
xine-lib and enigma2 are included in openpliPC main repo and code
is already patched ready to compile.
Some tasks require root access (sudo). You will be asked for your password.

./build_openpliPC.sh 
If you are interested to have a logfile , simply do:
./build_openpliPC.sh 2>&1 | tee build_log.log

./build_openpliPC.sh has some command-line options
./build_openpliPC.sh -h  to see them

4) Build oscam: (only for testing and learning)
Some tasks require root access (sudo). You will be asked for your password.

./build_oscam.sh
If you are interested to have a logfile , simply do:
./build_oscam.sh 2>&1 | tee build_oscam.log

Config files location in the directory  - /etc/vdr/oscam

5) Build plugins and skins for Enigma2:

./build_plugins.sh

6) See additional scripts in the directory enigma2pc/scripts/

   First start the script dvb_my.sh - loading module dvbsoftwareca.ko, create symlinks for dvb adapters, start oscam
   Two start the script autostart.sh - launch enigma2

------------------------------
Where is Enigma2 ?
------------------------------

Enigma2 will be installed in /usr/local/e2/ (see build_openpliPC.sh $INSTALL_E2DIR )
Example configs in /usr/local/e2/etc/enigma2/
The hole /proc/stb directory are located at /usr/local/e2/etc/stb/


------------------------------
Run enigma2
------------------------------

Enigma2 requires to be launched as root user:
sudo /usr/local/e2/bin/enigma2

If you are inside openpliPC/ simply do:
sudo ./e2bin

If you are concerned about security, build and run Enigma2 in a Virtual Machine


------------------------------
Informations
------------------------------

1)
with xine_vdpau I get osd, video (SD and HD) and sound,
with xine_xshm I get video (SD and HD) and sound ,
with xine_sdl I get only video (SD and HD) in size 720x576 they donÂ´t scale and sound.

VDPAU has the best results but it's only available with Nvidia graphics cards
VDPAU library use Nvidia GPU as MPEG2/4 hardware coprocessor speeding up decode process
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDPAU
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_PureVideo

Here you can find a message about VDPAU benchmark and performance:
http://openpli.org/forums/topic/20871-build-script-for-openpli-enigma2-on-ubuntu-104-32-bit/page__view__findpost__p__239696
not all Nvidia cards are able to play HD video using VDPAU


2)
Some remote control keys are remapped to local PC keyboard

RED     ->  F1
GREEN   ->  F2
YELLOW  ->  F3
BLUE    ->  F4

VOL UP    ->  +  (numeric pad) or +
VOL DOWN  ->  -  (numeric pad) or -

NEXT CHANN. -> ARROW DOWN
PREV CHANN. -> ARROW UP
NEXT BOUQUET -> PAGE DOWN
PREV BOUQUET -> PAGE UP

EXIT    ->  ESC
MENU    ->  SPACE
INFO    ->  I or F5
OK      ->  ENTER

EPG     ->  E or F6
POWER   ->  F10
RECORD  ->  R
TV      ->  T
VIDEO   ->  V
AUDIO   ->  A
RADIO   ->  D
MUTE    ->  M
TIMESHIFT ->  P

QUIT ENIGMA2      ->  X
FULL SCREEN MODE  ->  F11

For native lirc support edit 
the file $INSTALL_E2DIR/etc/enigma2/remote.conf (see build_openpliPC.sh $INSTALL_E2DIR )
Right format file:
Lirc_key=Enigma2_key

Example remote.conf for Remote MCE (mceusb):

Up=KEY_UP
Down=KEY_DOWN
Right=KEY_RIGHT
Left=KEY_LEFT
OK=KEY_OK
Back=KEY_ESC
Guide=KEY_MENU
Pause=KEY_AUDIO
Mute=KEY_MUTE
RecTV=KEY_VIDEO
LiveTV=KEY_TV
Star=KEY_RED
Clear=KEY_GREEN
Enter=KEY_YELLOW
Hash=KEY_BLUE
Play=KEY_PLAYPAUSE
CTRL_KEY_S=KEY_STOP
Replay=KEY_PREVIOUS
Skip=KEY_NEXT
Record=KEY_RECORD
Rewind=KEY_PREVIOUSSONG
Forward=KEY_NEXTSONG
ChanDown=KEY_CHANNELDOWN
ChanUp=KEY_CHANNELUP
More=KEY_INFO
One=KEY_1
Two=KEY_2

3)
Default NIM is configured in /usr/local/e2/etc/tuxbox/nim_sockets
NIM Socket 0:
            Type: DVB-S2
            Name: VTUNER
            Has_Outputs: no
            Frontend_Device: 0

If you want to change or add NIM, you must edit nim_sockets file.
Example: to change from DVB-S2 to DVB-T NIM, change "Type" as below
NIM Socket 0:
            Type: DVB-T
            Name: VTUNER
            Has_Outputs: no
            Frontend_Device: 0

Example two DVB-S(S2,T) cards with one frontend:
NIM Socket 0:
            Type: DVB-S2
            Name: VTUNER
            Has_Outputs: no
            Frontend_Device: 0
NIM Socket 1:
            Type: DVB-S2
            Name: VTUNER
            Has_Outputs: no
            Frontend_Device: 1

4)
Adding systemplugins, extensions or skins 
put systemplugins in /usr/local/e2/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/SystemPlugins
put extensions in /usr/local/e2/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/Extensions
put skin in /usr/local/e2/share/enigma2


5)
In order to record a movie you must create the /hdd/movies directory or use a symbolic link
i.e. 
sudo ln -s /my/movie/archive /hdd
sudo mkdir /hdd/movies


6)
/usr/local/e2/share/enigma2/xine.conf has many options about video and audio control
take a look into it


7)
Using vtuner http://code.google.com/p/vtuner/ user can share his tuner over network connection.
It's a client/server software. Server must be installed where you have a tuner (i.e. your STB like CT9x00 , DM800 ..) 
and client must be installed where you have not the physical tuner (i.e. PC)

8)
For looking TS-files downloading from internet or recordings (VDR)
use script e2pc_tslook.ts in the directory scripts.
Start script in the directory with TS-files or change variable DIR_TS
and wait while script create meta-files for TS-files.
When launch 'e2pc_tslook.ts meta' or 'e2pc_tslook.ts start' create meta-files for enigma2pc
When launch 'e2pc_tslook.ts clear' or 'e2pc_tslook.ts stop' remove meta-files
Also change AUDIO_LANG='your_launguage'

Cougar for porting Enigma2 to Enigma2PC.
nobody9 and betacentauri the further progress of the project.
kanber_kav  implement a Mediaplayer in Enigma2PC over xinelib without gstreamer and implement subtitles.
buyukbang  for testing.
ambrosa  for testing, cosmethic changes of the scripts, docs.
